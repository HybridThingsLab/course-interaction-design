## Setup
In the end there are a thousand ways to code with p5.js - let's stick to the following toolchain to dive into our course so that it will be easier to support each other.

### Environment
Download and install Visual Studio Code (free), https://code.visualstudio.com

### P5.js Library
P5.js basically is Processing in a Browser.

We neatly packed this into the repository you will download in a later step.
More Details on P5.js:
* P5.js, https://p5js.org
* P5.js VS Processing, https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Processing-transition 
* Libraries, https://p5js.org/libraries/
* Learn, https://p5js.org/learn/

### Extensions for Visual Studio Code
In Visual Studio Code click the Button with the 4 squares "Extensions", search for and "Install" the extension.

* p5js Snippets
* JSON Tools
* Live Server
* Beautify
* Only if __REALLY__ needed: German Language Pack for Visual Studio Code

### Browser
We strongly recommend Google Chrome, https://www.google.com/chrome/

How to set Chrome as your default browser for Live Server in Visual Studio Code:

* Install extension 'Live Server' (see instructions above)
* Go to File > Preferences > Settings
* Search for "browser"
* In settings "Live Server > Settings: Custom Browser" choose "Chrome"

### Code Repository
We packed a bunch of examples from this course as well together with the files needed for p5.js in a folder structure on GitHub. We will update this repository from time to time to correct bugs or add new examples. There are two ways to get all these files.

1. __PREFERRED__: In Visual Studio Code click the "Files" Icon, then "Clone Repository", paste the Repository URL https://github.com/HybridThingsLab/course-interaction-design, hit Enter, create a folder for our files and select it as download location.
2. Fallback: Download the repository from the GitHub Website (https://github.com/HybridThingsLab/course-interaction-design). Use button "Clone or Download" on the top right side of the page, download the ZIP and extract it.

### Get going
* In Visual Studio Code klick the "Files" Icon and navigate to "Block_I > p5js > examples > template"

You will see some files but these are the most important:

1. `sketch.js`: Thats where you code
2. `index.html`: Thats where you can see your result
* Click `sketch.js` to open it in the code editor
* Right klick `index.html` > "Open with Live Server" to open it in your browser
* If asked, allow the html to access the internet

note: in the tutorials another editor is used. But currently Shiffmann also uses Visual Studio Code.
